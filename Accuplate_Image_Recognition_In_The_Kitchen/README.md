AccuPlate – Image Recognition in the Kitchen

Developed Accuplate, an AI-driven ingredient recognition and recipe recommendation web application that uses image inputs to detect ingredients and suggest personalized recipes with step-by-step guidance. It combines YOLOv5 / CNN-based detection with a Flask web app and a recipe database, focusing on practical, user-friendly AI for everyday cooking.
